### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
These native coins will facilitate secure and accessible financial services tailored for African communities, promoting economic empowerment and sustainable development.

### Trading and Exchange
The native coins developed by AfricaCryptoChainx, including ACC, AFR, AFT, and others, will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows users to buy, sell, and trade these coins alongside established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and African-based coins like Akoin, BakeryToken (BAKE), and My Neighbour Alice (ALICE). Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

### Security Considerations

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "python"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Python Code for Secure Infrastructure

```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def secure_infrastructure():
    api_key = generate_api_key()
    hashed_data = hash_data("user_data")
    secure_communication(api_key, hashed_data)
    print("Secure infrastructure implemented.")

def generate_api_key():
    return hashlib.sha256("your_random_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()

def hash_data(data):
    secret_key = b'your_secret_key'
    return hmac.new(secret_key, data.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

def secure_communication(api_key, data):
    pass

secure_infrastructure()
```

### Docker

To containerize AfricaCryptoChainx using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**

   Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
   COPY requirements.txt .

   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy the rest of the application code into the container
   COPY . .

   # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
   EXPOSE 80

   # Define environment variable
   ENV NAME World

   # Run app.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t africacryptochainx .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**

   Run the following command to start a container from your image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:80 africacryptochainx
   ```

### CCXT Integration

To integrate CCXT for cryptocurrency exchange support, follow these steps:

1. **Install CCXT**

   Add CCXT to your `requirements.txt` file:

   ```
   ccxt
   ```

   Then install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install ccxt
   ```

2. **Sample CCXT Integration Code**

   Use the following code to connect to a cryptocurrency exchange:

   ```python
   import ccxt

   def get_exchange_data():
       exchange = ccxt.binance()  # Replace 'binance' with your desired exchange
       markets = exchange.load_markets()
       ticker = exchange.fetch_ticker('BTC/USDT')
       print(f"BTC/USDT Ticker: {ticker}")

   get_exchange_data()
   ```

   Replace `'binance'` with the desired exchange name and adjust the market symbol as needed.
