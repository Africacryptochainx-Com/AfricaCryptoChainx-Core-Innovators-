1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new directory in your repository called `.github/workflows`.
   - Create a file named `wallet-transaction.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Add the following content to the `wallet-transaction.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Wallet Transaction Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Filter by Keyword
      if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'CCXT Wallet')
      run: echo "Relevant keyword found in issue"

    - name: Filter by File
      if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}
      run: |
        FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }})
        echo "$FILES" | grep 'transactions/' && echo "Transaction file changed" || echo "No relevant file changes"
```

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
These native coins will facilitate secure and accessible financial services tailored for African communities, promoting economic empowerment and sustainable development.

### Trading and Exchange
The native coins developed by AfricaCryptoChainx, including ACC, AFR, AFT, and others, will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows users to buy, sell, and trade these coins alongside established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and African-based coins like Akoin, BakeryToken (BAKE), and My Neighbour Alice (ALICE). Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

JavaScript version of CCXT works in both Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and async/await syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is not excluded in your babel-loader config.

ccxt in NPM

npm install ccxt
//cjs
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
//esm
import {version, exchanges} from 'ccxt';
console.log(version, Object.keys(exchanges));
JavaScript (for use with the <script> tag):
All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from a CDN of your choice:

jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.4.9/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js
unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ccxt@4.4.9/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js
CDNs are not updated in real-time and may have delays. Defaulting to the most recent version without specifying the version number is not recommended. Please, keep in mind that we are not responsible for the correct operation of those CDN servers.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.4.9/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js"></script>
Creates a global ccxt object:

console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
Python
ccxt in PyPI

pip install ccxt
import ccxt
print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes
The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.7.0+

import ccxt.async_support as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt
PHP
ccxt in PHP with Packagist/Composer (PHP 7.0+)

It requires common PHP modules:

cURL
mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
PCRE
iconv
gmp (this is a built-in extension as of PHP 7.2+)
include "ccxt.php";
var_dump (\ccxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes
The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode using tools from RecoilPHP and ReactPHP in PHP 7.1+. Read the Manual for more details.

.net/C#
ccxt in C# with Nuget (netstandard 2.0 and netstandard 2.1)

using ccxt;
Console.WriteLine(ccxt.Exchanges) // check this later
Docker
You can get CCXT installed in a container along with all the supported languages and dependencies. This may be useful if you want to contribute to CCXT (e.g. run the build scripts and tests — please see the Contributing document for the details on that).

Using docker-compose (in the cloned CCXT repository):

docker-compose run --rm ccxt
You don't need the Docker image if you're not going to develop CCXT. If you just want to use CCXT – just install it as a regular package into your project.

Documentation
Read the Manual for more details.

Usage
Intro
The CCXT library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part immediately after installation. Public APIs provide unrestricted access to public information for all exchange markets without the need to register a user account or have an API key.

Public APIs include the following:

market data
instruments/trading pairs
price feeds (exchange rates)
order books
trade history
tickers
OHLC(V) for charting
other public endpoints
In order to trade with private APIs you need to obtain API keys from an exchange's website. It usually means signing up to the exchange and creating API keys for your account. Some exchanges require personal info or identification. Sometimes verification may be necessary as well. In this case you will need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchanges expose API endpoints for registering an account, but most exchanges don't. You will have to sign up and create API keys on their websites.

Private APIs allow the following:

manage personal account info
query account balances
trade by making market and limit orders
deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto funds
query personal orders
get ledger history
transfer funds between accounts
use merchant services
This library implements full public and private REST and WebSocket APIs for all exchanges in TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

The CCXT library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in TypeScript and JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.

// both of these notations work in JavaScript/Python/PHP
exchange.methodName ()  // camelcase pseudocode
exchange.method_name () // underscore pseudocode
Read the Manual for more details.

JavaScript
CCXT now supports ESM and CJS modules

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
These native coins will facilitate secure and accessible financial services tailored for African communities, promoting economic empowerment and sustainable development.

### Trading and Exchange
The native coins developed by AfricaCryptoChainx, including ACC, AFR, AFT, and others, will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows users to buy, sell, and trade these coins alongside established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and African-based coins like Akoin, BakeryToken (BAKE), and My Neighbour Alice (ALICE). Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

```

### Python Code for Secure Infrastructure

```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def secure_infrastructure():
    api_key = generate_api_key()
    hashed_data = hash_data("user_data")
    secure_communication(api_key, hashed_data)
    print("Secure infrastructure implemented.")

def generate_api_key():
    return hashlib.sha256("your_random_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()

def hash_data(data):

1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
These native coins will facilitate secure and accessible financial services tailored for African communities, promoting economic empowerment and sustainable development.

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
These native coins will facilitate secure and accessible financial services tailored for African communities, promoting economic empowerment and sustainable development.

### Trading and Exchange
The native coins developed by AfricaCryptoChainx, including ACC, AFR, AFT, and others, will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows users to buy, sell, and trade these coins alongside established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and African-based coins like Akoin, BakeryToken (BAKE), and My Neighbour Alice (ALICE). Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

## Install

The easiest way to install the CCXT library is to use a package manager:

- [ccxt in **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccxt) (JavaScript / Node v7.6+)
- [ccxt in **PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt) (Python 3.7.0+)
- [ccxt in **Packagist/Composer**](https://packagist.org/packages/ccxt/ccxt) (PHP 7.0+)
- [ccxt in **Nuget**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ccxt) (netstandard 2.0)

This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:

- [js/](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/js/) in JavaScript
- [python/](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/python/) in Python (generated from JS)
- [php/](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/php/) in PHP (generated from JS)

You can also clone it into your project directory from [ccxt GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git  # including 1GB of commit history

# or

git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git --depth 1  # avoid downloading 1GB of commit history
```

### JavaScript (NPM)

JavaScript version of CCXT works in both Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and `async/await` syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is [not excluded](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/issues/225#issuecomment-331905178) in your `babel-loader` config.

[ccxt in **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccxt)

```shell
npm install ccxt
```

```JavaScript
//cjs
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```
```Javascript
//esm
import {version, exchanges} from 'ccxt';
console.log(version, Object.keys(exchanges));
```

### JavaScript (for use with the `<script>` tag):

All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from a CDN of your choice:

* jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.3.50/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js
* unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ccxt@4.3.50/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js

CDNs are not updated in real-time and may have delays. Defaulting to the most recent version without specifying the version number is not recommended. Please, keep in mind that we are not responsible for the correct operation of those CDN servers.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.3.50/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js"></script>
```

Creates a global `ccxt` object:

```JavaScript
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```

### Python

[ccxt in **PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt)

```shell
pip install ccxt
```

```Python
import ccxt
print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes
```

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.7.0+

```Python
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt
```

### PHP

[ccxt in PHP with **Packagist/Composer**](https://packagist.org/packages/ccxt/ccxt) (PHP 7.0+)

It requires common PHP modules:

- cURL
- mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
- PCRE
- iconv
- gmp (this is a built-in extension as of PHP 7.2+)

```PHP
include "ccxt.php";
var_dump (\ccxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes
```

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode using tools from [RecoilPHP](https://github.com/recoilphp/recoil) and [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/) in PHP 7.1+. Read the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/) for more details.

### .net/C#

[ccxt in C# with **Nuget**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ccxt) (netstandard 2.0 and netstandard 2.1)
```c#
using ccxt;
Console.WriteLine(ccxt.Exchanges) // check this later
```

### Docker

You can get CCXT installed in a container along with all the supported languages and dependencies. This may be useful if you want to contribute to CCXT (e.g. run the build scripts and tests — please see the [Contributing](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for the details on that).

Using `docker-compose` (in the cloned CCXT repository):

```shell
docker-compose run --rm ccxt
```

You don't need the Docker image if you're not going to develop CCXT. If you just want to use CCXT – just install it as a regular package into your project.

## Documentation

Read the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/) for more details.

## Usage

### Intro

The CCXT library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part immediately after installation. Public APIs provide unrestricted access to public information for all exchange markets without the need to register a user account or have an API key.

Public APIs include the following:

- market data
- instruments/trading pairs
- price feeds (exchange rates)
- order books
- trade history
- tickers
- OHLC(V) for charting
- other public endpoints

In order to trade with private APIs you need to obtain API keys from an exchange's website. It usually means signing up to the exchange and creating API keys for your account. Some exchanges require personal info or identification. Sometimes verification may be necessary as well. In this case you will need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchanges expose API endpoints for registering an account, but most exchanges don't. You will have to sign up and create API keys on their websites.

Private APIs allow the following:

- manage personal account info
- query account balances
- trade by making market and limit orders
- deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto funds
- query personal orders
- get ledger history
- transfer funds between accounts
- use merchant services

This library implements full public and private REST and WebSocket APIs for all exchanges in TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

The CCXT library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in TypeScript and JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.

```JavaScript
// both of these notations work in JavaScript/Python/PHP
exchange.methodName ()  // camelcase pseudocode
exchange.method_name () // underscore pseudocode
```

Read the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/) for more details.

### JavaScript

**CCXT now supports ESM and CJS modules**

#### CJS

```JavaScript
// cjs example
'use strict';
const ccxt = require ('ccxt');

(async function () {
    let kraken    = new ccxt.kraken ()
    let bitfinex  = new ccxt.bitfinex ({ verbose: true })
    let huobipro  = new ccxt.huobipro ()
    let okcoinusd = new ccxt.okcoin ({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
        secret: 'YOUR_SECRET_PRIVATE_KEY',
    })

    const exchangeId = 'binance'
        , exchangeClass = ccxt[exchangeId]
        , exchange = new exchangeClass ({
            'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
            'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET',
        })

    console.log (kraken.id,    await kraken.loadMarkets ())
    console.log (bitfinex.id,  await bitfinex.loadMarkets  ())
    console.log (huobipro.id,  await huobipro.loadMarkets ())

    console.log (kraken.id,    await kraken.fetchOrderBook (kraken.symbols[0]))
    console.log (bitfinex.id,  await bitfinex.fetchTicker ('BTC/USD'))
    console.log (huobipro.id,  await huobipro.fetchTrades ('ETH/USDT'))

    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.fetchBalance ())

    // sell 1 BTC/USD for market price, sell a bitcoin for dollars immediately
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.createMarketSellOrder ('BTC/USD', 1))

    // buy 1 BTC/USD for $2500, you pay $2500 and receive ฿1 when the order is closed
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.createLimitBuyOrder ('BTC/USD', 1, 2500.00))

    // pass/redefine custom exchange-specific order params: type, amount, price or whatever
    // use a custom order type
    bitfinex.createLimitSellOrder ('BTC/USD', 1, 10, { 'type': 'trailing-stop' })

}) ();
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
   - Consolidated Docker and Buildx plugin download and installation into a single `RUN` statement.
